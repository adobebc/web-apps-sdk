    	<h3>Meet The Team</h3>
    	<p>This is not really our team, it's just a bunch of images from a stock photography site. We have created this sample app to familiarize you with developing apps for the Business Catalyst Platform. To find out how this app was created please read the <a class="contrast" href="http://developers.businesscatalyst.com/samples/meet-the-team-app.html" target="_blank">Sample Documentation</a>.</p>
