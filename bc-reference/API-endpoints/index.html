<h1>Getting Started with Business Catalyst's APIs</h1><p>Business Catalyst offers a wide range of APIs which allow developers to easily extend the core functionality of the platform, create entirely new applications on top of our infrastructure, and integrate with external third-party systems.</p><h2>Supported APIs</h2>
<p>Business Catalyst currently supports two protocols: the older eCommerce and CRM APIs utilize the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> protocol, while all new APIs are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> over HTTPs.</p><h2>Interacting with APIs</h2>
<p>When making API calls you need to be in the context of a BC app. This means you will need to register an app key and create a simple app that will provide the context for your API calls.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="/developers/apps/build-your-first-app#hello_world">Building a basic "Hello World"</a> custom app section to get your app going as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2>Before you get started</h2>
<p>There are a few important things to watch out for when interacting with BC's APIs:</p><ul>  <li>We recommend to access the API endpoints using relative paths. That is because API calls are using the domain of the app they run in, not the site's domain. Take a look at the <a href="/developers/api/authorize-your-api-calls#context">Authorize your API calls</a> article for more details on how this works</li>
<li>In the endpoint's request path we recommend to use <em>current</em> instead of the actual siteID </li>
<li>Once you've finished the <a href="/developers/developer-documentation/authorize-your-api-calls">authorization sequence</a> and got the access token, always send this as an "Authorization" header with your HTTP request</li></ul><h2 id="examples">Example API requests</h2>
<p>Before running any API calls you will need to <a href="/developers/apps/register-your-app">register a BC App key in your Partner Portal</a> and install a &quot;blank&quot; app like sothe "<a href="/developers/apps/build-your-first-app#hello_world">Hello World</a>" sample app.</p>
<p>Once the app is installed click its menu entry in the Admin console to open up the app and then hit F12 to open up Chrome Developer Tools.</p><p>Switch across to the "Sources" tab, open up the index.html landing page and add a break like so:</p><p><a class="fancybox" href="//screencasteu.worldsecuresystems.com/Mihai_T/2013-11-05_1028.png"><img src="//screencasteu.worldsecuresystems.com/Mihai_T/2013-11-05_1028.png?Action=thumbnail&Width=500&algorithm=fill"></a></p><p>This break will pause the script and will allow us to run the test API calls while in context of the app.</p><p>After adding the break, click the app's Open Admin menu item again. This should fire it again and this time it will stop at the break we added.</p><p>At this point you can test any of the <a href="/dev-assets/reference/api-endpoints/index.html">API calls available</a>, let's take a look at a few of them.</p><h3>1. Get a list of Web Apps that exist on the current site</h3><p>Now that we are in the app's context, got the access token we can pass it through as an Authorization header to access the range APIs available.</p><p>Let's grab a list of the Web Apps that exist on the website we're currently logged in to. Paste the following code into the Console and hit enter to run:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// Perform the AJAX request (make sure you've set the access token  
var request =
    $.ajax({
        url: "/api/v2/admin/sites/current/webapps",
        type: "GET",
        headers: {
            "Authorization": $.cookie('access_token')
        },
        contentType: "application/json"
    });
// Request successful, response is in "msg" variable  
request.done(function (msg) {
    console.log("Request successful");
    console.log(msg);
}); // Request failed, you can add your own error handling  
request.fail(function (jqXHR) {
    console.log("Request failed. Error code: " + jqXHR.status);
});</code></pre>

<p>If the request is successful, you'll be returned a object containing the response data <a href="/dev-assets/reference/api-endpoints/web-apps/list-web-apps.html">documented here.</a></p><p>Again we've used jQuery to send an AJAX request to the List Web Apps API endpoint and written some simple success/error handling to deal with the response. You'll notice we're able to use <strong>current</strong> in the place of specifiying the Site ID, as we're sending the request to our secure/system site URL.</p><p>From the returned object, you could then use the Get Web App Item List method (sending the ID of the desired Web App) to request a list of all items that exist for a specific Web App.</p><h3>2. Create a new Web App</h3><p>We can also easily create an actual Web App using the API. This time we'll be using a POST request instead of a GET request, as we need to tell BC what we want our Web App to look like.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// Perform the AJAX request (make sure you've set the access token  
var request = $.ajax({
    url: "/api/v2/admin/sites/current/webapps",
    type: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Authorization": $.cookie('access_token')
    },
    contentType: "application/json",
    data: '{"name": "MyWebApp"}'
}); // Request successful, response is in "msg" variable  
request.done(function (msg) {
    console.log("Request successful");
    console.log(msg);
}); // Request failed, you can add your own error handling  
request.fail(function (jqXHR) {
    console.log("Request failed. Error code: " + jqXHR.status);
});</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that this time we've specified the type as POST and sent some JSON data through to BC that defines our new Web App's properties.</p><p>You can expand upon this JSON string to set a range of other Web App properties. <a href="/dev-assets/reference/api-endpoints/web-apps/create-web-app.html">See the parameters here</a> for a complete list of what's supported.</p><h3>3. Add a new Web App item</h3><p>Now that we have an empty Web App, let's add an item. Paste the following code in the Console and hit enter to run:</p><div class="alert alert-info"><p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll need to replace "MyWebApp" with the name of your actual Web App for this to work.</p></div>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// Perform the AJAX request (make sure you've set the access token  
var request = $.ajax({
    url: "/api/v2/admin/sites/current/webapps/MyWebApp/items",
    type: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Authorization": $.cookie('access_token')
    },
    contentType: "application/json",
    data: '{ "name": "MyWebAppItem" }'
}); // Request successful, response is in "msg" variable  
request.done(function (msg) {
    console.log("Request successful");
    console.log(msg);
}); // Request failed, you can add your own error handling  
request.fail(function (jqXHR) {
    console.log("Request failed. Error code: " + jqXHR.status);
});</code></pre>

<p>We're using the Create Web App Item API method and an AJAX POST request to send BC the details of our new Web App item.</p><p>Just like our previous example, we've defined the Web App Item name here using JSON data sent during the request. You can find a <a href="/dev-assets/reference/api-endpoints/web-app-items/create-web-app-item.html">full list of item parameters supported here.</a></p>
<p>To update an existing Web App item, you use the PUT HTTP method instead of POST. <a href="/dev-assets/reference/api-endpoints/web-app-items/update-web-app-item.html">See the Update webapp item reference article.</a></p>
